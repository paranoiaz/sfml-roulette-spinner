# SFML Roulette Spinner
Experience smooth animations and a fun time using a functional spinner included with a coin system.

**Notes**

It is recommend if you are compiling SFML from source to create the directories **lib** and **include** in the root directory to store the compiled header files. If you want to use a different method or compiler you can edit the **Makefile** to your preferences. Compile and run the spinner using ```make```. Use ```make clean``` to remove all files generated during compile time.
